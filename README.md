## ‚úÖ Features
- No **broad storage permission** (`MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`) required

- Auto-switches to **KB / MB / GB**  
- Works from **Android 10 ‚Üí 14**

## üöÄ Build & Run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dikshant005/storage-tracker
cd storage_tracker
flutter pub get
flutter run --release
```

## üîê Permissions Asked

| Permission | Reason |
|------------|--------|
| `READ_MEDIA_IMAGES` | Count & size of pictures |
| `READ_MEDIA_VIDEO` | Count & size of videos |
| `READ_MEDIA_AUDIO` | Count & size of music |
| `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` *(legacy)* | Fallback for Android ‚â§ 11 |

## üìÇ Scan Logic

| Step | What Happens |
|------|--------------|
| 1 | Request narrow media permissions (`READ_MEDIA_*`) at runtime |
| 2 | Walk **only** shared external storage (`/storage/emulated/0`) |
| 3 | Skip **Android/data** & **Android/obb** (scoped-storage protected) |
| 4 | Group files by extension ‚Üí Images, Videos, Audio, Documents |
| 5 | Sum **count** and **bytes** per group |
| 6 | Other = every remaining file **not** in the four groups above |
| 7 | Convert bytes ‚Üí KB / MB / GB with one-decimal precision |
